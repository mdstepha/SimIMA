If the user is working on SLX-formatted simulink model file, and they invoke Simxample on that model,
Simxample creates an intermediate MDL-formatted simulink model file. This is because SLX-formatted files 
are not accepted by Simone clone detector. 

This directory contains such MDL formatted file (generated by slx2mdl.m). This MDL file must have the same
filename as the original SLX formatted file (with a different extension i.e. .mdl instead of .slx) -- the 
reason is explained in createMdlFileForSimone (see comment).
